# CovidAnalysis

This folder contains different analysis associated with COVID information I have developed. 

### 1. [Web Scraping Analysis](./1.Covid_Beliefs) 
                                                --> This analysis focus on the understanding of different belief from people from different part of the world, based on a survey                                                        performed by Belot et al (2020). The focus of the analysis is understand which variables, personal or cultural, could affect                                                        the people's beliefs about the severity of the Covid19 (SARS-COV-2)

### 1. [Web Scraping Analysis](./2.Covid_Flu/Pneu) 
                                                --> This analysis focus on compare the total amount of deaths produced by Flu/Pneuomonia before COVID arrives (2018) against the                                                        amount of total deaths produced by Flu/Pneumonio after COVID arrives (2020). The main goal is trying to understand if in 2020,                                                      the amount of deaths produced by Flu/Pneumonia have had increase/decrease after COVID.
