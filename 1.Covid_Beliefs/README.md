# Covid Beliefs

  Belot et al (2020) conducted a survey thorugh different countries, collecting information about work and living situations, income, behavior, beliefs about COVID 19, and exposure to the virus, from people US, China, Japan, Italy, Korea, and UK. I took the dataset collected by them and performed a descriptive analysis in order to understand the data and a regression model with it. The main idea was trying to understand which variables could affect people's beliefs and level of awareness about COVID. 
  In this section you will find 3 files:
  
  ### 1. [Graphs](./Covid_Beliefs_Graphs.ipynb)
      
  --> This file contains the python code used to create all the graphics that help me to understand the dataset better. 
      
### 2. [Regression_Analysis](./Regression_Analysis.py)

  --> This file contains the python code used to create two regression analysis in order to understand if there was any variable statistically significative that could help to people's belief about COVID
